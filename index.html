            <h3>A description</h3>
            <span>
                Epic: The Musical is a loose adaptation of Homer's "The Odyssey" by Jorge Rivera-Herrans, who wrote the music and 
                lyrics and also orchestrated and produced the tracks. His song clips and process videos have gone viral on social media 
                with over 60 million views across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

            <h4>The Beginning</h4>
            <div class="beginningFlex">
                <span>
                    Rivera-Herrans first started working on the musical around June of 2019 in his college dorms. 
                    He wanted to create a musical that was inspired by video games and anime/manga to "emulate their addictive sense 
                    of progression". He was heavily inspired by these forms of media and its effects are seen throughout the musical.

                    On January 17th, 2021 he uploaded his first video on TikTok where he introduces the musical and sings one of the 
                    older drafts of the opening song Full Speed Ahead. Over time he released other clips of songs from the musical that slowly began to garner an audience.

            <h4>The Process</h4>
            <span>
                Following his TikTok, there is an entire timeline of his journey through the making of each song up to the release of each saga. He has created 
                videos documenting his process as he goes through the songs, edits and rewrites in the span of about 2 years. He also held auditions over TikTok 
                to find voices for the characters. The first notable audition was for Calypso in April of 2021 following which there have been auditions for Ares, Penelope, Zeus, 
                Tiresias and more. Many of the songs in the musical went through rewrites with some songs being cut and other having been 
                changed to better fit the story and characters. The final draft was completed on the 29th of August, 2022.

                There was a lot of attention to detail put into the creation of the songs of EPIC. 
                Many of the songs draw inspiration from video game characters, epic moments in the media, and movies. Some of the most notable ones are:

                <li>
                    Many of the characters in EPIC are represented by specific instruments like Odysseus (Guitar), Athena (Piano), Poseidon (Trumpet +Brass Section), Circe (Cello), Zeus (
                    Electronic Base + Drums), Aeolus (Airy Vocals + Flute), Aphrodite (Saxophone), Apollo (Lyre), etc.

                <li>
                    Furthermore, the more divine the music gets the more electronic elements are heard in the score. 
                    The mortals generally get more traditional orchestral music, while the gods get more electronic music.

                <li>
                    Vocal backing for the mortal characters usually come from characters present in a given scene like the "CREW" or "SOLDIERS" 
                    while backing vocals for the gods come from an ENSEMBLE the god created to emphasize their point or emotions in a given scene.
